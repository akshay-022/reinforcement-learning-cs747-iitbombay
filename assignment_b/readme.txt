The command to be run to train task 1 is-

python mountain_car.py --task T1 --train 1

We will get the training plot in T1.jpg in the same folder as mountain_car.py .





The command to be run to test task 1 on other initial states, and get the average reward is-

python mountain_car.py --task T1 --train 0

(you can change the initial state of the car by changing the random seed in the .__main__ function)









The command to be run to train task 2 is-

python mountain_car.py --task T2 --train 1

We will get the training plot in T1.jpg in the same folder as mountain_car.py .





The command to be run to test task 2 on other initial states, and get the average reward is-

python mountain_car.py --task T2 --train 0

(you can change the initial state of the car by changing the random seed in the .__main__ function)
